I'm an electrical engineering student, trying to do every and anything. I'm distracted by essentially everything, and that is one of the reasons why I've decided to start this blog. I'm learning law (planning to pass the bar), botany, psychology, literature, linguistics, languages (German and Sanskrit---currently Spanish B2 proficient), philosophy, protein folding, culture, tradition, medieval society, epigraphy.
