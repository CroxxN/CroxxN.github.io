I'm an electrical engineering student, trying to do every and anything. I'm distracted by essentially everything, and that is one of the reasons why I've decided to start this blog. I'm learning law (planning to pass the bar), botany, psychology, literature, linguistics, languages (German and Sanskrit---currently Spanish B2 proficient), philosophy, protein folding, culture, tradition, medieval society, epigraphy. I'm not sure if I can master all of it. If I do epiphany of the mortal world awaits, if I don't that of immortal awaits. For all of life is spent in persuance of one kind or other; what aesthetic merit you assign to any object is within your testimony.
