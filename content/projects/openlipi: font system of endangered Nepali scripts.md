[open-sourcing soon](https://saalik.tech)

`openlipi` is my on-going initiative to digitize all of Nepal's endagered scripts. Fonts for the Pre-lichchhavi script has been developed; currently working on others. This is a very involved project which needs support from governmental authorities. Certified by the National Archives of Nepal. [email](mailto:sarad@saalik.tech) for donation. The ultimate goal is to submit all these script to the Unicode Consortium.
