`openlipi` is my on-going initiative to digitize all of Nepal's endagered scripts. Fonts for lichchhavi script has been developed; currently working on others. This is a very involved project which needs collaboration from governmental authorities. Certified by the National Archives of Nepal. [email](mailto:sarad@saalik.tech) for donation. Ultimate goal to submited all these script to the Unicode Consortium.
