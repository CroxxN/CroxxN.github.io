`jwst_echoes` converts images---specifically that of space---to sound. Instruments are configurable, ranging from Violin and guitar to drums. It analyses bright and dim pixels in a image, and assigns a comparative metric to every group of pixels (configurable). It can also generate video with progress bar. An ode to James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Pink Floyd's echoes.
