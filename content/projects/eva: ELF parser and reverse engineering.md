`eva` is an ELF-parser, visualizer, part-time linker, and part-time binary decompiler. It specializes in the ELF specification, and thus its primary target is linux program (though any ELF file can be parsed). The ultimate goal of `eva` is to be a linker and decompiler---decompiling bin -> asm -> c.
